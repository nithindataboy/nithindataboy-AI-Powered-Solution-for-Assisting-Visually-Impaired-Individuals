AI-Powered Solution for Assisting Visually Impaired Individuals
Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered application to assist visually impaired individuals in perceiving and interacting with their environment. By leveraging Generative AI, this solution provides real-time scene understanding, text-to-speech conversion for visual content, and object and obstacle detection for safer navigation.

The application uses Streamlit for the user interface and integrates Langchain and Google Generative AI to enhance the functionality, making it a comprehensive tool for visually impaired users.

Key Features
Real-Time Scene Understanding
The application generates descriptive textual output that interprets the content of the uploaded image, helping users understand the scene around them.

Text-to-Speech Conversion
Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), the app extracts text from images and converts it into audible speech, providing accessibility for reading visual content.

Object and Obstacle Detection for Safe Navigation
The application identifies objects or obstacles in the image and highlights them, providing insights to enhance user safety and situational awareness.

Personalized Assistance for Daily Tasks
The app offers task-specific guidance based on uploaded images, such as recognizing items, reading labels, or providing contextual information to help with daily tasks.

Technologies Used
Streamlit: Used to build the interactive web application interface.
Langchain: Integrated for natural language processing and content generation.
Google Generative AI: Utilized to generate scene descriptions and personalized responses.
Pytesseract: For text extraction using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
OpenCV & YOLOv4: For object and obstacle detection within images.
How It Works
Users upload an image.
The app provides the option to:
Describe the scene in the image.
Read the extracted text aloud.
Detect objects and obstacles for better navigation.
Provide personalized assistance based on the image content.
The solution leverages AI models to process the images, extract relevant information, and offer actionable insights.
